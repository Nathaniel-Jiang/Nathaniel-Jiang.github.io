            <h1>Hi there — I’m Peng (Nathaniel) Jiang</h1>
            <h3>PhD Student in Atmospheric Sciences at University of Washington</h3>
            <p>I’m a researcher with over four years of experience studying the formation and evolution of air pollutants (gases and aerosols) and their impact on air quality and human health. I hold a master’s degree in Power Engineering & Engineering Thermal Physics from Wuhan University of Technology (2022), where I worked under Prof. Yu Wang. Following that, I served as a research assistant at Hong Kong Polytechnic University under Dr. Ruoyu You. Now, I’m pursuing my PhD to deepen my expertise in aerosol science and air quality at the University of Washington.</p>
