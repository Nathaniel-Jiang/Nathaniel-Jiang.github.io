            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>With over four years of focused research experience, I have developed a deep interest in the formation and evolution of air pollutants (gases and aerosols) and their impact on air quality and human health. My drive to improve environmental conditions and enhance public health motivates me to continue expanding my knowledge and research skills.</p>

            <p>My current research interests include the formation and evolution of air pollutants, such as particulate matter, inorganic/organic aerosols, and volatile organic compounds, and their effects on air quality and public health. This research is pivotal for developing strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution on human health and the environment.</p>

                        <i>Independent Research: Experimental and kinetic study on aromatic formation in counterflow diffusion flames of methane and methane/ethylene mixtures</i>
                        (2021/08 - 2022/06)

                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Aromatics are molecular soot precursors, yet detailed kinetic mechanisms describing their formation in flame environments are insufficient even for the simplest hydrocarbon fuel of methane. Considering the building roles of methane-related chemistry in current hierarchically-structured mechanisms, the present study is devoted to the chemistry of aromatic formation in CH<sub>4</sub> flames. We established a series of incipiently sooting methane counterflow diffusion flames (CDF) and characterized their thermochemical structures including the scalar fields of temperature, concentrations of major species, C<sub>2</sub>–C<sub>4</sub> minor intermediates, benzene, large aromatic species, and soot volume fraction. The measurement techniques include tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS), gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC–MS) and laser induced incandescence (LII). The experimental dataset was then used to assess various recently proposed kinetic mechanisms. The results showed that the literature mechanisms tested would significantly overpredict benzene formation in CH<sub>4</sub> CDFs (up to a factor of 10). In addition, none of the tested mechanisms could capture the experimentally observed suppressing effects of CH<sub>4</sub> addition on the formation of aromatic species in C<sub>2</sub>–C<sub>4</sub> CDFs. Potential reactions responsible for the model failures are discussed. The main contributions of this study are to: 1) identify the limitations of existing aromatic mechanisms when applied to methane CDFs; 2) clarify potential reactions/pathways related to model deficiencies; 3) provide novel experimental dataset covering both gas-phase speciation and soot for methane CDFs. It is our hope that the present data and analysis would deepen our understanding on benzene formation chemistry, and contribute to the refinement of aromatic formation predictive models.</p>

                    <p><strong>My contributions:</strong> 1) Independently developed a method for measuring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to qualify and quantify PAHs with up to three rings in counterflow diffusion flames (CDFs). 2) Conducted an experimental study of C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>6</sub> intermediates and PAHs in methane and methane/ethylene flames using GC-MS to clarify reaction pathways and provide a novel dataset for gas-phase speciation and soot formation in methane CDFs. 3) Performed simulations using the OPPDIF module of the ANSYS Chemkin package to conduct kinetic pathway analysis.</p>
