                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Aromatics are molecular soot precursors, yet detailed kinetic mechanisms describing their formation in flame environments are insufficient even for the simplest hydrocarbon fuel of methane. Considering the building roles of methane-related chemistry in current hierarchically-structured mechanisms, the present study is devoted to the chemistry of aromatic formation in CH<sub>4</sub> flames. We established a series of incipiently sooting methane counterflow diffusion flames (CDF) and characterized their thermochemical structures including the scalar fields of temperature, concentrations of major species, C<sub>2</sub>–C<sub>4</sub> minor intermediates, benzene, large aromatic species, and soot volume fraction. The measurement techniques include tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS), gas chromatography–mass spectrometer (GC–MS) and laser induced incandescence (LII). The experimental dataset was then used to assess various recently proposed kinetic mechanisms. The results showed that the literature mechanisms tested would significantly overpredict benzene formation in CH<sub>4</sub> CDFs (up to a factor of 10). In addition, none of the tested mechanisms could capture the experimentally observed suppressing effects of CH<sub>4</sub> addition on the formation of aromatic species in C<sub>2</sub>–C<sub>4</sub> CDFs. Potential reactions responsible for the model failures are discussed. The main contributions of this study are to: 1) identify the limitations of existing aromatic mechanisms when applied to methane CDFs; 2) clarify potential reactions/pathways related to model deficiencies; 3) provide novel experimental dataset covering both gas-phase speciation and soot for methane CDFs. It is our hope that the present data and analysis would deepen our understanding on benzene formation chemistry, and contribute to the refinement of aromatic formation predictive models.</p>

                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This work reports an experimental and numerical analysis on the sooting characteristics of butanol isomers. Light extinction and gas chromatography were used to measure soot and gas-phase species, respectively. Kinetic analysis of the tested flames was performed with detailed gas-phase mechanism and a sectional soot model. The present work aims to provide an understanding on the effects of butanol isomeric structures on sooting tendencies. For a comprehensive analysis, flames of both neat butanol fuels and butanol/hydrocarbon mixtures were studied. The results showed that the relative ranking of sooting tendencies among the butanol isomers were similar in neat butanol flames and in butanol-doped ethylene flames. In addition, we show that a small amount of butanol addition in ethylene flame enhanced soot formation. It was found that different isomeric structures mainly affected the formation of C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>3</sub>, which led to the different concentrations of important aromatic soot precursors. In the butanol-doped ethylene flames, the blending of the four butanol isomers increased the number of C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>3</sub> formation pathways, which in turn significantly increased the production of benzene. Structural effects explaining for the differences in the sooting tendencies of the four butanol isomers in neat butanol flames and ethylene/butanol flames were found to be the same.</p>

                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ammonia is considered as one of the most promising alternative fuels due to its carbon neutrality and the existing infrastructure for its mass production and delivery. However, burning neat ammonia has the issue of poor flame stability and high NOx emissions, making co-firing ammonia with conventional fuel a more feasible approach. The present work investigated the sooting characteristics of counterflow diffusion flames of ethylene/ammonia mixtures. Experimentally, soot volume fraction (SVF) and average soot particle diameter in the neat ethylene, ammonia- and nitrogen- doped flames were non-intrusively measured. Both SVF and average soot particles diameter were found to decrease with the addition of ammonia. Flame temperature were measured with tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy and the results suggested that the inhibiting effect of ammonia on soot formation was chemical instead of thermal. For further kinetic insights, numerical simulation with newly-constructed reaction mechanisms were performed and the results were compared against chemical speciation data from gas chromatography (GC) measurements; the results showed that ammonia doping would lead to more significant reduction of benzene concentration than nitrogen doping. Kinetic pathways of the chemical suppressing effect of ammonia addition on soot and its precursor formation were then explained based on numerical results. The major contribution of the present work can be summarized in the following aspects: 1) New comprehensive experimental data on sooting characteristics, important intermediate species concentrations of diffusion counterflow flames of ethylene/ammonia mixtures were provided for model validation; 2) One coupled mechanism with detailed hydrocarbon-nitrogen interactions was established to predict PAHs formation and soot formation; 3) Detailed chemical kinetics insight of ammonia effect on soot formation was presented in the counterflow flame.</p>

                    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Counterflow diffusion flame is a canonical non-premixed flame configuration that is suitable for studying complex combustion chemistries such as soot formation. An important objective of such studies is to build predictive kinetic models. For validation of these models, complete and accurate experimental characterization of the flames are essential. Existing counterflow flame- based soot studies focused primarily on the determination of soot volume fraction, while simultaneous measurements of temperature, species concentrations and in particular flow fields were less common. Here we performed an experimental multiparameter investigation for a comprehensive characterization of the most important physical and chemical properties of four benchmark ethylene and propane counterflow flames, with the intention to provide data with sufficient details for the setup of corresponding numerical simulations and the evaluation of the resulted numerical data. Particle image velocimetry, tunable diode laser absorption spectrometry, microprobe sampling with gas chromatography, laser light extinction, laser induced incandescence are the techniques used respectively to measure flow fields, temperature, gas-phase species, and soot. Special attention was given to the effects of radial profiles of nozzle exit velocity on the quasi-one-dimensional counterflow simulation, whose results were compared against both the experiments and two-dimensional simulation. Probe effects on speciation were also quantitatively evaluated by comparing CO<sub>2</sub> mole fraction as measured with the intrusive probe sampling as well as an independent optical technique. Our specially chosen ethylene and propane flames offered a direct experimental evidence that a flame producing higher concentration of benzene can have a significantly lower sooting tendency. It is hoped that the present comprehensive dataset can serve as a useful validation target for future high-fidelity gas-phase and soot models. It is also our intention that we provide sufficient details regarding the experimental apparatus and associated measurement techniques so that interested readers can reproduce our experimental data.</p>
