            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>With over four years of focused research experience, I have developed a deep interest in the formation and evolution of air pollutants (gases and aerosols) and their impact on air quality and human health. My drive to improve environmental conditions and enhance public health motivates me to continue expanding my knowledge and research skills. My current research interests include the formation and evolution of air pollutants, such as particulate matter, inorganic/organic aerosols, and volatile organic compounds, and their effects on air quality and public health. This research is pivotal for developing strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution on human health and the environment.
